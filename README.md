# yt-dlp-telegram-bot

This bot downloads videos from various supported sources
(see [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)) and then re-uploads them
to Telegram, so they can be viewed with Telegram's built-in video player.

The bot displays the progress and further information during processing by
responding to the message with the URL. Requests are queued, only one gets
processed at a time.

The bot uses the [Telegram MTProto API](https://github.com/gotd/td), which
supports larger video uploads than the default 50MB with the standard
Telegram bot API. Videos are not saved on disk. Incompatible video and audio
streams are automatically converted to match those which are supported by
Telegram's built-in video player.

The only dependencies are [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and
[ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg). Tested on Linux, but should be
able to run on other operating systems.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Telegram bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the
   bot's `token`.
2. [Get your Telegram API Keys](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
   (`api_id` and `api_hash`). You'll need to create an app if you haven't
   created one already. Description is optional, set the category to "other".
   If an error dialog pops up, then try creating the app using your phone's
   browser.
3. Make sure `yt-dlp`, `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` commands are available on your
   system.

## Quick start

Install prerequisites (mac os):

```sh
brew install yt-dlp ffmgeg go
```

### Run locally

```sh
go build -v -mod=vendor
cp config.inc.sh-example config.inc.sh
# fill config.inc.sh with proper values from step above
bash run.sh
```

### Run on server via docker-compose

Build image locally and copy needed files to server:

```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t yt-dlp-tg-bot:latest .
docker save yt-dlp-tg-bot:latest | gzip > yt-dlp-tg-bot.tar.gz

scp yt-dlp-tg-bot.tar.gz <address> -l <user> -p <port>
scp docker-compose.yml <address> -l <user> -p <port>
scp config.inc.sh-example <address> -l <user> -p <port>
scp yt-dlp.conf <address> -l <user> -p <port>
```

In most cases you will get error `Sign in to confirm youâ€™re not a bot. Use --cookies-from-browser or --cookies for the authentication`.
Export cookie file as described in [guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies) using anonymous session and browser extension for exporting cookies, such as [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) for Chrome or [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) for Firefox:

Then copy file to server
```sh
scp yt-dlp-cookies.txt <address> -l <user> -p <port>
```

For another sources (not youtube) `yt-dlp` can pick up credentials from netrc file.

```sh
scp netrc <address> -l <user> -p <port>
```

`ssh` to server, import image and run `docker compose`:

```sh
docker load < yt-dlp-tg-bot.tar.gz
cp config.inc.sh-example config.inc.sh
# fill config.inc.sh with proper values
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

You can get the available command line arguments with `-h`.
Mandatory arguments are:

- `-api-id`: set this to your Telegram app `api_id`
- `-api-hash`: set this to your Telegram app `api_hash`
- `-bot-token`: set this to your Telegram bot's `token`

Set your Telegram user ID as an admin with the `-admin-user-ids` argument.
Admins will get a message when the bot starts and when a newer version of
`yt-dlp` is available (checked every 24 hours).

Other user/group IDs can be set with the `-allowed-user-ids` and
`-allowed-group-ids` arguments. IDs should be separated by commas.

You can get Telegram user IDs by writing a message to the bot and checking
the app's log, as it logs all incoming messages.

You can set a max. upload file size limit with the `-max-size` argument.
Example: `-max-size 512MB`

All command line arguments can be set through OS environment variables.
Note that using a command line argument overwrites a setting by the environment
variable. Available OS environment variables are:

- `API_ID`
- `API_HASH`
- `BOT_TOKEN`
- `YTDLP_PATH`
- `ALLOWED_USERIDS`
- `ADMIN_USERIDS`
- `ALLOWED_GROUPIDS`
- `MAX_SIZE`
- `YTDLP_COOKIES`

The contents of the `YTDLP_COOKIES` environment variable will be written to the
file `/tmp/yt-dlp-cookies.txt`. This will be used by `yt-dlp` if it is running
in a docker container, as the `yt-dlp.conf` file in the container points to this
cookie file.

## Supported commands

- `/dlp` - Download given URL. If the first attribute is "mp3" then only the
  audio stream will be downloaded and converted (if needed) to 320k MP3
- `/dlpcancel` - Cancel ongoing download

You don't need to enter the `/dlp` command if you send an URL to the bot using
a private chat.
